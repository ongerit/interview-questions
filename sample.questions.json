On site interviews: - Interview 1: After discussing past projects. Write test cases for a routine that takes input 2 Cartesian coordinates and draws a line joining them, but the display pane can show points only such that x and y are between -100 and 100. How would you design it for a blind person. Choose the best 6 test cases and why. - Interview 2: After discussing my resume. Write code to find all the palindromes in a string. Code both naive and efficient approaches. What if the string had spaces also, like \"race car\", which is also a palindrome. What if characters similar to an alphabet, from other languages were also be considered as the same character. What if you were implementing a web service with a page that takes input string in a textbox and displays all the palindromes. What test cases would you write to see the service works fine. What of your service was being used only by people in Germany. How can you optimize? - Interview 3: After resume discussion, talks for 5 minutes about his team, MS Office Sharepoint. Just 1 question for the entire interview. Given an API with a string argument and an int return type, what could it be doing. Imagine the different possibilities and how would you decide the testcases, based on the functionality of the API you thought of. Think on test that assure sanity, +ve examples, -ve examples, security, scalability of the API. - Interview 4: Discusses my resume, talks about his team and shortly about his experience of 20 years at MSFT (at which I instantly remarked, I would have never been able to pull that off!). Says that I see from your feedback that you are more of a problem solver, so I would like to test your imagination. Asks me to implement string.Split(some char) API of C#. Write test cases that would fail my code. Write code to fix those failures, iterate till all are resolved. At the end, tries to sell me the SDET position, says it's lots of fun and SDE/SDET switching happens every couple of years. Otherwise, MSFT pampers it on-site invitees. They pick you up from the hotel and airport in a limo, $75/day just for meals, crazy discounts in the MSFT store, free taxi/rental car to explore the city and $50 reimbursable, apart from meals and taxis if you want to buy other stuff.",

E.g. the above glob and test actually match. Problem is: write an algorithm to match glob with test. You MAY NOT use regular expressions :D 2. The input is any string of any length of any characters. Write a program to generate ALL unique permutations of those characters. Unique. You may not store in an array or list, due to memory constraints. e.g. for input of abc your program should give 6 permutations but for aba your program should give 3.

(odd question, more from \"management\" than engineering domain). Another non-coding question: the code isn't running as expected (running on device emulator), while you can't find any errors in it. What could it be, likely? (The answer is: emulator itself had not been thoroughly tested)",

        "question": "Consider a \"word\" as any sequence of capital letters A-Z (not limited to just \"dictionary words\"). For any word with at least two different letters, there are other words composed of the same letters but in a different order (for instance, STATIONARILY/ANTIROYALIST, which happen to both be dictionary words; for our purposes \"AAIILNORSTTY\" is also a \"word\" composed of the same letters as these two). We can then assign a number to every word, based on where it falls in an alphabetically sorted list of all words made up of the same set of letters. One way to do this would be to generate the entire list of words and find the desired one, but this would be slow if the word is long. Write a program which takes a word as a command line argument and prints to standard output its number. Do not use the method above of generating the entire list. Your program should be able to accept any word 20 letters or less in length (possibly with some letters repeated), and should use no more than 1 GB of memory and take no more than 500 milliseconds to run. Any answer we check will fit in a 64-bit integer. Sample words, with their rank: ABAB = 2 AAAB = 1 BAAA = 4 QUESTION = 24572 BOOKKEEPER = 10743 NONINTUITIVENESS = 8222334634 Your program will be judged on how fast it runs and how clearly the code is written. We will be running your program as well as reading the source code, so anything you can do to make this process easier would be appreciated.",

For the purposes of this question, normalizing means: • all single dot components of the path must be removed. For example, \"foo/./bar\" should be normalized to \"foo/bar\". • all double dots components of the path must be removed, along with their parent directory. For example, \"foo/bar/../baz\" should be normalized to \"foo/baz\". That's it. Normally, a path normalization algorithm would do a lot of other stuff, but for this question, don't try any other kind of normalization or transformation of the path. As an example, \"foo//bar\" should be normalized to \"foo//bar\" (i.e. a no-op). Use any language you feel comfortable in, we prefer Java, but it’s not required. The method should take in a string (or whatever passes for a string in the language of your choice) and return a string representing the normalized path. Please write code that you feel proud of and would check in to source control in a professional environment. 2. Once you have completed the exercise, please create ten (or more!) test cases you would you use to test the method.",

There were also one followup question about changing the \"rules\" of the game and how it would affect the algorithms.",
